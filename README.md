# Dissertation - Blockchain based peer-to-peer personal finance system â€“ A Token Engineering Approach

## Abstract
The rapid growth of technology has lead to the creation of digital platforms that act as a trusted
third-party between lenders of borrowers in schemes such as peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding
and rotating and credit savings associations, ROSCA, where members pool together regular
savings which are then dispersed to each member in turn. In this scenario, we aim to connect
lenders and borrowers in a cost-optimal and secure way. 

Blockchain technology aims to keep track of a ledger of valid transactions between agents of a virtual 
economy without the need for a central institution for coordination[29]. These inherent features of 
blockchain enable a transparent, cost-effective, democratic alternative to existing personal finance models.

Based on this, we propose a blockchain-based model of ROSCA, in the context of token engi-
neering, which makes it possible to design and analyse economic systems in a manner consistent
with the best practices of systems engineering. 

Our proposed distributed system compromises three main components: A robust peer-to-peer network 
over which agents interact. The addition of a rich agent-based model - derived from economics and 
mathematics, which serves to outline all possible agent strategies allowing us to design incentives 
and penalties. And finally, mechanisms to facilitate the governance of a system without a central governing body.

We validate our model through simulation, intending to examine questions related to how
financial rewards, incentives and the number of participants affect the outcome. And whether
the proposed model is, in fact, fairer, more decentralised and democratic than existing models.
The experimental results show the proposed model yields better returns in terms of
reward vs cost for participants compared to the traditional centralised model of ROSCA.
